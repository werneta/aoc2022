My solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 (https://adventofcode.com/2022/),
written in Lua 5.4.
Each day's problems are in a subfolder matching the day number.
Run the `run.sh` function on any system with lua installed to execute both
problem parts.
For now I'm trying to avoid using any non standard libraries.
We'll see how far I get.
